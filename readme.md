The **Decentralized Governance for Community Learning Centers** is a smart contract solution built on the Ethereum blockchain to enable a decentralized decision-making process for community learning centers. It allows stakeholders to propose changes, vote on proposals, and automatically execute decisions based on the outcome of the vote. This contract provides a transparent and trustless system for the community to govern aspects of their learning center, such as curriculum changes, budget allocation, and overall management.

This smart contract ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to influence decisions and that governance is not centralized in the hands of a single entity.

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to empower local communities to take charge of the decision-making processes within their learning centers, fostering inclusivity, transparency, and collective ownership. By using blockchain technology, the governance process is made open, immutable, and resistant to manipulation, allowing decisions to be made in the best interest of the community. Ultimately, the project aims to scale to other community-driven initiatives where decentralized governance can improve accountability and participation.

### Key Features

- Proposal Creation: 
  - Admins can create proposals for changes or actions to be taken within the community learning center. Proposals include a description of the change, as well as a duration for voting.
  
- Decentralized Voting: 
  - Community members can vote on proposals. Each member can vote "For" or "Against" a proposal, ensuring that all voices are heard.
  
- Time-Limited Voting: 
  - Each proposa
l has a specified voting period. Voting closes automatically once the duration ends, ensuring timely decision-making.
  
- Proposal Execution: 
  - After the voting period ends, the proposal is automatically executed based on whether it received more votes "For" than "Against." The result is broadcasted and the proposal is marked as executed.
  
- Transparency and Accountability: 
  - All actions are publicly available on the blockchain. Voting outcomes and proposal execution results are transparent, ensuring the integrity of the governance process.
  
-  Proposal Details: 
  - Anyone can view the details of an![Screenshot 2024-12-21 142825](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/080d2767-ac96-4f14-88b4-547e7a871c06)

- Active Proposals : 
  - Users can view a list of all currently active proposals and participate in ongoing votes.
